News 360 is an AI based news site. Here you can get the latest news by saying ‘give me the latest news’ simply. And the website will automatically scroll and read the news headline when you grant to read the headline. Also you can get news by term, category and source. The website has guidelines on how to use this site. By using this website you also can know the weather info. I have fetched this news data from an API link which I collect from the newsapi website. I have used functional based components or react hooks in this site. For responsiveness on this site i have used material ui.
